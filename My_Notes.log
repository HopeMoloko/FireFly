- Model is made up of the same number of real sources.
- Model --> Circularly Gaussian Function

- Do I add noise to the model or not? No.
- Noise level (sigma,centered at 0)

- Nested sampling , with mcmc for evolving a new point.
- MCMC uses a while-loop and breaks when it gets a better point.

- Do mcmc with a for-loop and check acceptance ratio.

-My acceptance ratio is being going to one all this time, How??
- rewrite the whole Algorithm one more time(Nope)


- Acceptance ratio always going to one may be a very small stepsize

--I have been using a One dimensional Gaussian function-Likelihood !!! It's Ok.
- I changed that but I'm not getting good results at all --Wrong.

- When i set prior to zero given that the sample is not within the interval, weird things happen.

        Accpt = 0
        for j in range(ndim):
            
            if (interval[0]<= new_point[j] <= interval[1]):
                Accpt += 1
        
        if Accpt == 4:
            prior = 1
        else: 
            prior = 0
            
    ---- This was because there was a bug!!
     
     Likelihood_new = loglike(new_point)*prior is WRONG!
     Likelihood_new = loglike(new_point)+log(prior) is Right!
     
 -I have changed the acceptance Ratio:
 
    > log_alpha = Likelihood_new-Likelihood_old
    > alpha = np.exp(log_alpha)
    
  - Larger stepsize longer runtime  (around 3 sigma)
  -Small stepsize needs more nest runs lower runtime ( around 0.5 sigma)
  
  - I haven't pushed up the number of sources because i need to make sure the simple case finds the sources.
  
  -Bugs Found:
  --Acceptance ratio
  --Likelihood_new = loglike(new_point)*prior (I forgot i was working in log-space)
  -- Weighting the posterior results (Went back to skillings paper)
  
  -Current problem:
  -I can only  find one a single source. Was I finding all sources by chance depending on stepsize,nest runs ?? Not sure.
  --> 
  - I only find atleast one so far, (maybe there's another bug but i double checked)
  - I need to let it run for a very long time? correct stepsize? -- Uncertain
